    <h2>Why Use the JILIKO Mobile App?</h2>
    <p>
      Mobile gaming has become the preferred choice for many users in the Philippines,
      and the JILIKO app is designed specifically to meet this demand. Compared to using
      a browser, the app offers faster loading times, smoother gameplay, and easier access
      to your account.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app layout is optimized for smaller screens, allowing users to navigate games,
      wallets, and settings without confusion. Notifications, quick logins, and stable
      performance are some of the major reasons players choose the mobile version.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Supported Devices and System Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Before downloading, it is important to understand whether your device supports
      the JILIKO app. The app is compatible with most modern smartphones and tablets.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Android devices with updated system versions</li>
      <li>iOS devices using Safari-based installation</li>
      <li>Stable internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data)</li>

    <img src="https://jiliko1225.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jiliko-mobile.webp" alt="JILIKO mobile app">

    <p>
      Downloading the JILIKO app is straightforward, but because it is not always listed
      on public app stores, users must follow the official download process carefully.
    </p>

    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step">
        <strong>Step 1: Visit the official site</strong>
        <p>
          Open your mobile browser and access the official JILIKO website.
          From there, you will see a clear option to download the mobile app.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <strong>Step 2: Choose your device type</strong>
        <p>
          Select Android or iOS depending on your phone. The system will automatically
          prepare the correct installation file for your device.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <strong>Step 3: Allow installation</strong>
        <p>
          Android users may need to allow installations from unknown sources.
          This is a standard step and does not indicate any security risk.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <strong>Step 4: Complete installation</strong>
        <p>
          Once downloaded, tap the file and follow the on-screen instructions
          until the app is successfully installed.
